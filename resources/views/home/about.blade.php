                            Started as a side project in September 2016, dployr was my solution to a problem I had noticed with other FTP deployment solutions.

                            I'd noticed that on larger, American, deployment services that they deployed quite slowly to my Australian servers. I had long waits for simple sites to be deployed and so I thought I'd have my own go, I'm fascinated by the technology sitting underneath these sites and so I'm hoping that in my own efforts to achieve faster deployments that I can help others deploy their sites faster too.

                            I've had others help me along the way, Vedran Tonsic designed the logo for me, I think it's fantastic. He's also been a fantastic sounding board for ideas. Another person who's gotten behind the project is my friend Jason Lewis, he's been another great sounding board and spent a considerable amount of his time reviewing the code for dployr to make sure that the site is as efficient as it can be.
